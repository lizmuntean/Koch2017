Working to convert excel tables into csv. Some trouble with the headers and the formatting, need to be sorted out manually.

Hello Dr. Klironomos,

I very much enjoyed your 2017 paper in New Phytologist, Evolutionary asymmetry in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, conservatism in fungal morphology does not predict host plant growth. I am currently a Master's student at Tulane University in Louisiana participating in a Data and Software class for biologists learning how to code and reproduce the results from scientific papers. The figures in your paper are compelling to me and I believe learning how to create them would be very useful for my research. I am particularly interest in reproducing Figure 2. Is there any chance you would be able to share the code you used to make the figure? I would be beyond grateful. Thank you so much for your time!

Sincerely,

Liz Muntean
